# Exercise 6: Analysing data using NumPy
This week we will continue working with real data files, but with NumPy instead of the basic Python tools.
We have two data files that we will load and analyse.
They should be somewhat familiar already.

## Problem 0: Creating a plotly account
[plotly](https://plot.ly/) is a web-based platform for creating and sharing interactive graphs and presentations.
It also happens to have an easy-to-use function for exporting plots generated using the Matplotlib plotting module (which we will see next week) to plotly.
We're going to experiment with using this, because we think interactive plotting on the web will become increasingly common in the future (plus it's cool!).
So, your first task in this week's exercise is to go to the plotly website and [create a free community account](https://plot.ly/accounts/login/?action=signup).
The instructions for doing so should be clear on the plotly website.
